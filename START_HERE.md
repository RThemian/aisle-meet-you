## 💡 What You're Building

**Aisle Meet You** is a dating app that solves the #1 problem with online dating: **people never actually meet**.

### The Innovation
Instead of endless swiping and chatting, users:
1. **Broadcast** when they're at a location (gym, cafe, grocery store)
2. **Signal** they're open to being approached
3. **See others** broadcasting at the same venue
4. **Send approach requests** if interested
5. **Meet in person** immediately if mutual

### Why It's Different
- ✅ No catfishing (meet in person right away)
- ✅ No ghosting (you're both there now)
- ✅ No time waste (meet same day)
- ✅ Safe (public places, daylight)
- ✅ Natural (real-world context)

**Solution:** Location-based availability signals + immediate IRL meetings  
**Revenue:** Freemium ($9.99/month) + venue partnerships ($500-2K/month)

## 🎯 The Bottom Line

**You have three things that matter:**

1. **A unique idea** - No one else is doing real-time location broadcasting for dating
2. **A working prototype** - Investors can see and touch it
3. **A clear path forward** - The docs explain exactly what to do

**What you DON'T have:**
- Users (yet)
- Revenue (yet)
- Competition (yet - but they will come)

**This means:** MOVE FAST. First mover advantage is everything.
