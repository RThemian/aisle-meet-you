## The Pitch (30 seconds)

*"Dating apps are broken - endless swiping, ghosting, never actually meeting. We let you broadcast when you're at a gym, cafe, or grocery store and open to being approached. Others there can see you're available and send a request. Mutual interest? Meet in person immediately. It's Tinder meets Happn, but with actual real-world meetings."*
